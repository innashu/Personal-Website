            </h3>

            <p>
                I'm a strategist who thrives at the intersection of people and possibility.
                <br><br>
                I grew up in Brooklyn, where my family settled after immigrating from Uzbekistan. Guided by curiosity
                and a love of exploration, I lived in various cities around the world before landing in San Francisco in
                2024. I‚Äôll always have the New York hustle, but SF has quickly captured my soul.
                <br><br>
                I‚Äôm an adventurer at heart and a thrill-seeker by nature. I love movement, exploring the unknown, and
                pushing boundaries. Whether its strength training at the gym, hiking new trails or getting
                scuba-certified in Costa Rica, I‚Äôm always chasing the edge of what‚Äôs possible and exploring all the
                world has to offer.
                <br><br>
                The most meaningful part of my life is my community. I thrive in deep, honest relationships, the kind
                built on trust, warmth, laughter, and showing up. These values - a love for people and partnerships, a
                spirit of curiosity, and an appetite for adventure - have also shaped my career.

            </h3>

            <p>
                I‚Äôm a customer-centric strategist who helps teams bridge vision and execution through thoughtful product
                launches, scalable operations, and high-impact partnerships. I‚Äôm passionate about turning customer
                insights into clear strategy and working cross-functionally to drive meaningful outcomes. I thrive in
                roles where I can bring clarity to complexity, align teams around a shared purpose, and move ideas into
                action. I care deeply about building trusted relationships and creating environments where teams feel
                supported, empowered, and equipped to succeed. Whether working with clients or internal stakeholders, I
                bring intention, heart, and curiosity, with a focus on creating meaningful, lasting impact.
                <br><br>
                Over the last decade, I‚Äôve built a career at the intersection of people, strategy, and execution, with a
                track record of leading high-impact projects that bridge the vision and execution through thoughtful
                product launches and operational scale.
                <br><br>
                Most recently, I was an Engagement Manager at Trinity Life Sciences, where I led end-to-end delivery for
                global life sciences clients, managed executive relationships, and oversaw high-performing teams. I
                partnered with clients ranging from biotech founders to big pharma leaders to define strategic roadmaps,
                align cross-functional teams, and ensure successful execution. I also pitched and launched a new line of
                business that generated $20M+ in revenue, set and tracked KPIs across engagements, and facilitated
                weekly leadership calls focused on pipeline, client health, and delivery priorities. Alongside this, I
                coached and mentored a team of consultants ‚Äî supporting both their project performance and professional
                growth.
                <br><br>
                Before that, I completed a two-year finance leadership development program at ThermoFisher Scientific
                and took on roles across FP&A and strategy. I led the forecasting of full P&Ls for a $2B division, built
                global five-year market models to inform portfolio strategy, and regularly briefed senior leadership on
                key drivers of performance, market dynamics, and strategic opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                For my next adventure, I‚Äôm looking for a dynamic role at a mission-driven company where I can elevate
                the customer voice to inform business and operational strategy, build trusted partnerships, and
                collaborate cross-functionally to turn ambitious ideas into real market impact.
