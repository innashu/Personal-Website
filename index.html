            </h3>

            <p>
                I'm a strategist who thrives at the intersection of people and possibility.
                <br><br>
                I grew up in Brooklyn, where my family settled after immigrating from Uzbekistan. Guided by curiosity
                and a love of exploration, I lived in various cities around the world before landing in San Francisco in
                2024. I’ll always have the New York hustle, but SF has quickly captured my soul.
                <br><br>
                I’m an adventurer at heart and a thrill-seeker by nature. I love movement, exploring the unknown, and
                pushing boundaries. Whether its strength training at the gym, hiking new trails or getting
                scuba-certified in Costa Rica, I’m always chasing the edge of what’s possible and exploring all the
                world has to offer.
                <br><br>
                The most meaningful part of my life is my community. I thrive in deep, honest relationships, the kind
                built on trust, warmth, laughter, and showing up. These values - a love for people and partnerships, a
                spirit of curiosity, and an appetite for adventure - have also shaped my career.


            </p>

                <span class="highlight">Experience</span>
            </h3>

            <p>
                I’m passionate about work that blends strategic thinking with meaningful execution, especially when it
                involves solving complex problems that bring together the customer voice and a clear strategic purpose.
                I care deeply about building partnerships that are grounded in trust and momentum, and about leading
                teams that feel supported, energized, and empowered to deliver. Whether I’m helping a client or internal
                team launch something new or scale an existing product, I bring structure, heart, and curiosity to the
                table, always focused on outcomes that create real impact.
                <br><br>
                Over the last decade, I’ve built a career at the intersection of people, strategy, and execution, with a
                track record of leading high-impact projects that bridge the vision and execution through thoughtful
                product launches and operational scale.
                <br><br>
                Most recently, I was an Engagement Manager at Trinity Life Sciences, where I led end-to-end delivery for
                global life sciences clients, managed executive relationships, and oversaw high-performing teams. I
                partnered with clients ranging from biotech founders to big pharma leaders to define strategic roadmaps,
                align cross-functional teams, and ensure successful execution. I also pitched and launched a new line of
                business that generated $20M+ in revenue, set and tracked KPIs across engagements, and facilitated
                weekly leadership calls focused on pipeline, client health, and delivery priorities. Alongside this, I
                coached and mentored a team of consultants — supporting both their project performance and professional
                growth.
                <br><br>
                Before that, I completed a two-year finance leadership development program at ThermoFisher Scientific
                and took on roles across FP&A and strategy. I led the forecasting of full P&Ls for a $2B division, built
                global five-year market models to inform portfolio strategy, and regularly briefed senior leadership on
                key drivers of performance, market dynamics, and strategic opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether building from scratch or scaling systems, I bring clarity to chaos and momentum to vision. I
                thrive in environments where curiosity meets structure and progress is people-powered.
